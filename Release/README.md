This directory is for packaging a release build of Crayon for distribution.

Run the Python script from the shell like this:

## Windows:

```C:\Stuff\Crayon\Release> python release.py windows```

## OSX:

```$ python release.py mono```

This will create a directory called `crayon-0.2.0-windows` or `crayon-0.2.0-mono`.
This is the same as the zip file you download directly from the site.
